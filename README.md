## ❌ Difficulties

The main difficulties surfaced around the code within the weather.service module. The reason being it kept calling a destructuring error, meaning the application was not able to retrieve the data once the city's name had been entered into the input field. I attempted sourcing stackoverflow, as well as resorting to using AI to attempt to complete the task however the code became convoluted and still was calling the same error in the console!
